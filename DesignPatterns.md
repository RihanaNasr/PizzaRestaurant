"Design Patterns in the Pizza Restaurant Ordering System"

1. Singleton Pattern
The singleton pattern ensures centralized control of resources by having only one instance of the `InventoryManager`, preventing inconsistent data and ensuring consistent inventory management.


2. Factory Pattern
The system simplifies pizza creation by allowing users to choose a pizza type without creating instances, thereby promoting decoupling between creation and usage.


3. Strategy Pattern
The system enables users to select various payment methods at runtime, promoting flexibility and separating payment logic from the pizza ordering process.


4. Decorator Pattern
The pattern dynamically adds toppings to pizza without modifying the original class, allowing flexibility and extending functionality by wrapping objects with additional behaviors like cheese or olives.


- Concept of Overengineering
Overengineering is the addition of unnecessary features or complexity without providing real value, while simplicity enhances clarity and reduces complexity.
